The [BDI-ABM Project][] software realises a mechanism for integrating 
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) reasoning in agents within an
agent-based simulation (ABM). The software framework provides the 
infrastructure that allows off-the-shelf
BDI and ABM systems to be combined. In this arrangement, conceptually, 
the *body* of the agent resides in the physical environment of the ABM while
the *brain* is programmed separately within the BDI system.

The concept is described in the following papers:
