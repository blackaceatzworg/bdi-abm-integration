The [BDI-ABM Project][] software realises a mechanism for integrating 
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) reasoning in agents within an
agent-based simulation (ABM). The concept is described
in the following papers papers:

*  Dhirendra Singh, Lin Padgham, Brian Logan. 
   Integrating BDI agents with Agent Based Simulation Platforms.
   Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems, 
   Volume 30, Issue 6, pages 1050-1071, 2016.
   
*  Lin Padgham, Kai Nagel, Dhirendra Singh, Qingyu Chen.
   Integrating BDI Agents into a MATSim Simulation. 
   Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications 263 (ECAI 2014), 
   pages 681-686, 2014.


# About this site

This site is hosted [here]([bdi-abm-website]) on [GitHub Pages][] and was 
generated using [Jekyll][] that supports writing pages using 
[Markdown][] syntax (you can have static HTML pages too of course). 

For more information on how
to set up a project website go to [GitHub Pages][].
The go to page for Jekyll configuration is 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages).

Jekyll comes with a bunch of themes too. This site uses the base Jekyll theme
[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). 
You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, 
as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [Jekyll][].
