# BDI-ABM Integration Package

This software realises a mechanism for interating 
Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) reasoning into agents within an
agent-based simulation (ABM). The concept is described
in the following papers papers:

1. Dhirendra Singh, Lin Padgham, Brian Logan. 
   Integrating BDI agents with Agent Based Simulation Platforms.
   Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems, 2015. 
   *Under review.*

2. Lin Padgham, Kai Nagel, Dhirendra Singh, Qingyu Chen.
   Integrating BDI Agents into a MATSim Simulation. 
   Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications 263 (ECAI 2014), 
   pages 681-686, 2014.

3. Lin Padgham, David Scerri, Gaya Buddhinath Jayatilleke, and Sarah Hickmott. 
   Integrating BDI reasoning into agent based modelling and simulation. 
   In Winter Simulation Conference (WSC), pages 345-356, 2011.



## How to use this software

Examples of BDI-ABM applications are provided in the `./examples` directory.

Any BDI-ABM application consists of three layers. A generic first layer
(`./integrations/bdi-abm`) manages the high level interaction and message
passing between the BDI and the ABM system. A second platform specific
layer realises the connection between a specific BDI platform (such as 
JACK, i.e., `./integrations/abm-jack`), and a specific ABM system (such 
as MATSim, i.e., `./integrations/bdi-matsim`). Finally, a third application
layer puts these together along with domain specific code (for instance
`./examples/bushfire). 

Overall, the repository consists of *integrations* and *examples*. Integrations
are platform specific and live in `./integrations`. Examples are domain 
specific, and live in `./examples`. The following integrations
are provided:
 
Integration   | Directory                   | Description
:-------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------------
BDI-ABM       | `./integrations/bdi-abm`    | BDI-ABM communication and data layer
BDI-GAMS      | `./integrations/bdi-gams`   | Integration for GAMS (www.gams.com) 
BDI-MATSim    | `./integrations/bdi-matsim` | Integration for MATSim (www.matsim.org)
ABM-JACK      | `./integrations/abm-jack`   | Integration for JACK (aosgrp.com/products/jack)
ABM-JILL      | `./integrations/abm-jill`   | Integration for JILL (http://agentsoz.github.io/jill)
ABM-Jadex     | `./integrations/abm-jadex`  | Integration for Jadex (http://www.activecomponents.org/bin/view/About/Features)

Integrations are pulled together to build application examples. The following
examples are provided:

Example             | Directory                  | Description
:-------------------|:---------------------------|:----------------------------
Bushfire            | `./examples/bushfire`      | Uses JACK and MATSim
Conservation Ethics | `./examples/cnoservation`  | Uses JACK and GAMS
Child Vaccination   | `./examples/vaccination`   | Uses JACK and a custom Python-based ABM

In addition to above, the repository consists of an *util* project. It lives in 
`./util` and contains the utility classes used by integration libraries and example 
applications in the repository.

Project     | Directory      | Description
:-----------|:---------------|:--------------------------------------------
Util        | `./util`       | Contains utility classes for integration libraries and example applications
