## Setup for developers

1. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v8 or higher as well as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to get started, so make sure you have those installed first.

1. Next, perform this one off setup to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
1. Now start the development server:
```
npm start
```
1. You can now code away and changes should automatically show at http://localhost:3000/.
